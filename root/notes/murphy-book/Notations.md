Machine learning/statistics notation
---

In general, we use upper case letters to denote constants, such as C, D, K, N, S, T, etc. We
use lower case letters as dummy indexes of the appropriate range, such as c = 1 : C to index
classes, j = 1 : D to index input features, k = 1 : K to index states or clusters, s = 1 : S to
index samples, t = 1 : T to index time, etc. To index data cases, we use the notation i = 1 : N,
although the notation n = 1 : N is also widely used.
We use x to represent an observed data vector. In a supervised problem, we use y or y to
represent the desired output label. We use z to represent a hidden variable. Sometimes we also
use q to represent a hidden discrete variable.

Graphical model notation
---

In graphical models, we index nodes by s, t, u ∈ V, and states by i, j, k ∈ X.
