To build a strong foundation in regression analysis for interviews or general understanding, consider covering the following topics:

1. **Simple Linear Regression:**
   - Definition and concept
   - Assumptions of linear regression
   - Method of least squares
   - Interpretation of coefficients
   - Calculation of residuals
   - Evaluation of model fit (R-squared, adjusted R-squared)

2. **Multiple Linear Regression:**
   - Extension of simple linear regression to multiple predictors
   - Interpretation of coefficients in the multiple regression context
   - Adjusted R-squared and model fit assessment
   - Collinearity issues and remedies (e.g., variance inflation factor)

3. **Model Building and Variable Selection:**
   - Forward selection, backward elimination, and stepwise regression
   - Criteria for variable selection (e.g., AIC, BIC, Mallows' Cp)
   - Cross-validation techniques for model validation

4. **Assumptions and Diagnostics:**
   - Normality of residuals
   - Homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals)
   - Independence of errors
   - Outlier detection and influential observations
   - Residual plots and diagnostics tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test, Durbin-Watson statistic)

5. **Non-linear Regression:**
   - Polynomial regression
   - Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
   - Transformation techniques (e.g., log transformation, Box-Cox transformation)

6. **Interaction and Dummy Variables:**
   - Incorporating interaction terms in regression models
   - Encoding categorical variables using dummy variables
   - Interpretation of coefficients in the presence of interaction terms

7. **Time Series Regression:**
   - Autocorrelation and its implications in time series data
   - Autoregressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models
   - Seasonal decomposition and forecasting techniques

8. **Robust Regression Methods:**
   - Robust regression techniques for handling outliers and influential observations (e.g., Huber regression, M-estimators)

9. **Generalized Linear Models (GLMs):**
   - Extension of linear regression to non-normal response variables
   - Logistic regression for binary outcomes
   - Poisson regression for count data

10. **Applications and Case Studies:**
    - Real-world applications of regression analysis in various fields (e.g., economics, healthcare, marketing)
    - Hands-on experience with regression analysis using statistical software (e.g., R, Python with libraries like Statsmodels, scikit-learn)

Understanding these topics will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of regression analysis, preparing you for interviews and enabling you to build robust regression models for data analysis and prediction tasks.

```py
import numpy as np

def linear_regression(x, y):
  """
  This function performs simple linear regression on the given data.

  Args:
    x: A 1D NumPy array of independent variables.
    y: A 1D NumPy array of dependent variables.

  Returns:
    A tuple containing the slope (m) and intercept (b) of the regression line.
  """
  # Calculate mean of x and y
  mean_x = np.mean(x)
  mean_y = np.mean(y)

  # Calculate numerator and denominator for slope
  numerator = np.sum((x - mean_x) * (y - mean_y))
  denominator = np.sum((x - mean_x) ** 2)

  # Calculate slope and intercept
  slope = numerator / denominator
  intercept = mean_y - slope * mean_x

  return slope, intercept

# Example usage
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

m, b = linear_regression(x, y)

print(f"Slope: {m:.4f}, Intercept: {b:.4f}")
