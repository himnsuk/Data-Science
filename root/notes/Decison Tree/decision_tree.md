Hyperparameters in Decision Tree
---

Hyperparameters in decision trees are parameters that are set prior to the training of the model and influence the structure and behavior of the tree. These hyperparameters control aspects such as the tree's depth, the number of samples required to split a node, and the criteria used for splitting. Proper tuning of these hyperparameters is crucial for achieving optimal performance and preventing overfitting. Here are some common hyperparameters in decision trees:

1. **Criterion**: This hyperparameter specifies the function used to measure the quality of a split. Common criteria include:
   - **Gini impurity**: A measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would be incorrectly labeled if it was randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset.
   - **Entropy**: Measures the level of impurity or randomness in a set of labels. It is also known as information gain.
   - **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Used in regression trees, it measures the variance of the target variable within the subsets created by a split.

2. **Max Depth (max_depth)**: The maximum depth of the tree. It limits the maximum number of levels in the decision tree, which helps prevent overfitting.

3. **Minimum Samples Split (min_samples_split)**: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. If a node has fewer samples than this parameter, it will not be split further.

4. **Minimum Samples Leaf (min_samples_leaf)**: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. This parameter prevents the creation of leaf nodes that represent very small subsets of the data and can lead to overfitting.

5. **Maximum Features (max_features)**: The maximum number of features to consider when looking for the best split. This parameter helps control the model's complexity and can prevent overfitting, especially in high-dimensional datasets.

6. **Class Weight (class_weight)**: This hyperparameter assigns weights to classes based on their frequencies. It is useful for handling imbalanced datasets by giving more weight to minority classes during training.

7. **Splitter**: This hyperparameter specifies the strategy used to choose the split at each node. Common options include "best" (chooses the best split) and "random" (chooses the best random split).

8. **Minimum Impurity Decrease (min_impurity_decrease)**: A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value. This parameter can be used to control the growth of the tree.

9. **Pruning Parameters**: Some decision tree algorithms support pruning techniques to reduce the size of the tree and prevent overfitting. Pruning parameters control the extent of pruning, such as the complexity parameter (CCP) in Cost-Complexity Pruning.

10. **Random State (random_state)**: This parameter ensures reproducibility by fixing the random seed used for splitting the data and building the tree.

Proper tuning of these hyperparameters is essential for optimizing the performance of decision tree models and achieving the desired balance between bias and variance. This tuning process is often done through techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.
